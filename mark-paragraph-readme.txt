;;; Commentary:

;; mark-paragraph.el contains some extra commands for marking a paragraph.
;; Inspired by https://twitter.com/nriley/status/1408049507775004675, I
;; checked Emacs and actually couldn't see a simple way of doing it out of
;; the box, so I quickly knocked this up for fun.
;;
;; Note that, right now, this doesn't attempt to do anything clever; I just
;; knocked this up as a reminder/placeholder to look and see if there's a
;; better way of doing this (it is something I've often found myself wanting
;; to have to hand).
