title: delpa --- davep's emacs lisp package archive
---

This is `delpa`, a small personal package archive for GNU Emacs. It isn't
intended as an alternative archive or anything like that, it's simply an
archive of personal code that I host via GitHub pages so I can quickly and
easily set up or update a GNU Emacs installation.

Information on how this came about can be found in a blog
post
[I wrote in April 2017](http://blog.davep.org/2017/04/01/another_revamp_of_my_emacs_config.html).

The code that lives here is the sort of thing that would make no sense in an
archive such as <a href="https://melpa.org/#/">melpa</a>, or which is in the
process of being tidied up for submission to melpa.
