geturl.el provides a simple command that will insert the URL of the
"topmost" instance of your web browser of choice.

Note that, at the moment, this only works on macOS. I seldom work for any
sensible time in any other environment so adding other platforms isn't a
priority right at the moment. The code is, however, written in a way that
it would be simple enough to extend.
