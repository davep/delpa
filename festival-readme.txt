;;; Commentary:
;;
;; festival.el provides a simple interface into the festival speech
;; synthesis program <URL:http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/> from
;; Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; BTW, it was only once I'd more or less finished writing the first version
;; of this that I noticed that a festival.el comes with festival itself
;; (yeah, I know, I should spend more time examining the contents of
;; software packages). As it is, I decided to press on with this anyway
;; because I'd done a couple of different things and, more importantly, I
;; was having far too much fun.
