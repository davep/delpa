;;; Commentary:

;; longmacs.el is designed to help me treat Emacs as something that should
;; be kept running for a long time. There's no need to start and stop an
;; editor like Emacs and this little package contains the bits I use to help
;; me keep bad habits under control.
;;
;; On my iMac and Macbook I tend to start an Emacs sesssion, run
;; `longmacs', turn it into a full-screen application, and then do
;; all my editing in there.
;;
;; See also uptimes.el for another tool to help encourage good Emacs use.
